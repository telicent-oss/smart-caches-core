# Change Log

# 0.33.0

- Event Source improvements:
    - Added additional overloads to `EventHeaderSink.Builder` for `fixedHeader()` and `fixedHeaderIfMissing()` that
      allow supplying the raw `byte[]` sequence to use as the header value rather than a `String`
    - **BREAKING** Marked the previously deprecated `EventHeaderSink.Builder` method `addDataSourceHeaders()` as
      `forRemoval` so any remaining usage will now trigger compiler errors 
- JAX-RS Base Server improvements:
    - Add new `RejectEmptyBodyFilter` that rejects `POST`/`PUT`/`PATCH` requests to JAX-RS resources that have a 
      `@Consumes` annotation to avoid edge cases where a bad request is made that leads to many errors.  This also
      provides much clearer feedback to API consumers about what was wrong with their request.

# 0.32.6

- Build improvements:
    - RDF-ABAC upgraded to 1.1.4

# 0.32.5

- JAX-RS Base Server improvements:

        - Added patched fork of `lz4-java` library

# 0.32.2

- JAX-RS Base Server improvements:
    - Improves handling of Jersey `MultiException` to avoid excessive stack trace logging in this scenario
        - **NB** Users may also want to add `<logger name="org.glassfish.jersey.internal.Errors" level="OFF" />` to
          their Logback configuration to avoid Jersery logging the stack traces as well
    - Improves some error handling logging to include what HTTP method, and other relevant request details, led to the
      error
- Build improvements:
    - RDF-ABAC upgraded to 1.1.3
    - Various build and test dependencies upgraded to latest available.

# 0.32.1

- Kafka Event Source improvements:
    - Improves logging from `KafkaEventSource` and related classes so that all logging statements include a `[topics]`
      prefix to make it easier to disambiguate logging statements from different event sources.
    - Removed a lag related warning that has proved spurious in production workloads
- Build improvements:
    - Apache Commons Lang upgraded to 3.20.0
    - JWT Servlet Auth upgraded to 2.0.2
    - RDF ABAC upgraded to 1.1.2
    - Various build and test dependencies upgraded to latest available.

# 0.32.0

**NB** Release failed to due to bad Maven metadata state

# 0.31.1

- JWT Auth Common improvements:
    - Added `CachingUserInfoLookup` to add caching around an underlying lookup to reduce unnecessary network requests
      when several requests from the same user arrive at the same time
- JAX-RS Base Server improvements:
    - When new Authorization feature is enabled the `UserAttributesInitializer` now sets the `AttributesStore`
      implementation to `AttributesStoreAuthServer`
    - `UserInfoFilter` now passes user attributes to `AttributesStoreAuthServer` so that applications have access to the
       necessary attributes to make security label decisions when providing access to data
- Build and Test improvements:
    - Caffeine upgraded to 3.2.3
    - Jackson upgraded to 2.20.1
    - Various build and test dependencies upgraded to latest available.

# 0.31.0

- JWT Auth Common improvements:
    - Improved how policy is located for JAX-RS resources to ensure that policy for inherited methods is properly
      located when those methods are invoked on child resource classes which may be overriding policy at the class level
          - **BREAKING** `PolicyLocator` helper methods gained an additional `Class<?>` argument to support this, this
          is an internal implementation detail so shouldn't affect most users
- Build and Test improvements:
    - Airline upgraded to 3.2.0
    - Apache Jena upgraded to 5.6.0
    - Logback Classic upgraded to 1.5.20
    - OpenTelemetry SDK upgraded to 1.55.0
    - RDF ABAC upgraded to 1.1.1
    - Various build and test dependencies upgraded to latest available.

# 0.30.1

- JWT Auth Common improvements:
    - Improved various utility methods on the `Policy` class based on implementation experience
    - Added `TelicentRoles` and `TelicentPermissions` classes which provide constants related to standard roles and
      permissions within the Telicent Core platform
    - Added builder API for creating `UserInfo` instances, as well as generated utility methods
    - `AuthorizationResult` now provides reasons for both clients/end users and logging purposes, logging reasons may
      divulge details of the authorization policy and **MUST** only be used for logging/audit purposes.
- Build and Test improvements:
    - Upgraded Logback to 1.5.19
    - Upgraded Lombok to 1.18.42
    - Upgraded OpenTelemetry SDK to 1.54.1
    - Various build and test dependencies upgraded to latest available.

# 0.30.0

- Kafka Event Source improvements:
    - Fixed a bug where `KafkaConfiguration.OUTPUT_TOPIC` constant had the incorrect environment variable name.
    - Fix for a bug where trying to serialize `RdfPayload` back to Kafka where the event declares a `Content-Type`
      header for an RDF serialization that does not support `DatasetGraph` serialization would fail. Now provided the
      payload only contains a default graph in the dataset that graph will be successfully serialized. If it doesn't
      then the resulting Kafka `SerializationException` now has a clearer error message.
- JWT Auth Common improvements:
    - New abstract `TelicentAuthorizationEngine` and related helper classes for enforcing roles and permissions based
      authorization policies on Telicent applications
    - New `UserInfoLookup` API with concrete `RemoteUserInfoLookup` implementation for exchanging JWTs for User Info
      from an OAuth2/OIDC servers `/userinfo`, or equivalent, endpoint
- JAX-RS Base Server improvements:
    - When Authentication is enabled new Authorization and User Info Lookup features are also enabled
    - When configured via new `USERINFO_URL` environment variable a new request filter automatically retrieves User Info
      and adds it to the request properties.
    - Authorization policies are enabled by adding annotations to JAX-RS resource classes/methods as needed so
      applications can be safely upgraded without impact and enable authorization policies once they are ready
    - Clarified documentation around both Authentication and Authorization features
    - Removed long deprecated `development` (since `0.16.0`) authentication mode constants and related code
    - Authenticated requests can now have User Info automatically retrieved from a configured OAuth2/OIDC `/userinfo`
      and added to request attributes for other filters to use
    - `MockKeyServer` improvements:
        - Fixed a bug in `MockKeyServer` (used for authentication testing) that broke test isolation and could cause
          test classes to run successfully on their own but fail when run as part of a test suite
        - `MockKeyServer` now provides a `/userinfo` endpoint (see `getUserInfoUrl()`) which creates mock User Info
          responses based on the requests authenticated JWT injecting stub default `roles`, `permissions` and
          `attributes` values
        - **BREAKING** `MockKeyServer` moved AWS ELB endpoints to `/aws/{key}`, provided you were using the
          `registerAsAwsRegion()` method this should be transparent to you. If you were manually configuring custom AWS
          regions for tests you will need to adjust URLs accordingly.
- Build and Test improvements:
    - Adjusted Surefire configuration in some modules to eliminate Mockito related warnings
    - Adjusted Surefire configuration in some modules to ensure test coverage data is gathered and enforced
    - Improved test coverage in some modules where above adjustments showed coverage had fallen below intended levels
    - **BREAKING** Various build and test dependencies upgraded to latest available. This includes a change to Jackson
      version numbering which has now diverged between Jackson Core and Jackson Annotations, requiring the introduction
      of an additional version property in Maven for Jackson Annotations.
- CLI improvements:
    - Many CLI options now have equivalent environment variables that may be used to configure them without needing to
      explicitly specify them.

# 0.29.6

- Projector Driver improvements:
    - Optionally configurable log label for applications that run multiple `ProjectorDriver` instances to help
      distinguish log output from different projections.

    - fixed a bug in CORS filtering that prevented allowed methods being recognised

# 0.29.3

- Minor Kafka improvements:
    - `AbstractReadPolicy` includes Kafka Consumer Group ID (if any) in logging of partition lag
    - `-t`/`--topic` option for CLI commands now permits comma separated lists of topics when specified via the `TOPIC`
      environment variable
    - CLI commands can now provide an application controlled default value to `KafkaOptions.getConsumerGroup()` to
      specify a more useful default group ID than the CLI command name derived one
- Build improvements:
    - Addressed some build warnings
    - Apache Commons IO upgraded to 2.20.0
    - Apache Jena upgraded to 5.5.0

# 0.29.2

- Projectors Core improvements:
    - Added a new `CircuitBreakerSink` that can be used to insert a circuit breaker into a pipeline.
- Projector Driver improvements:
    - Can now disable processing speed warnings for `ProjectorDriver` instances that will use low throughput event
      sources where processing speed is basically guaranteed to exceed remaining events.
- New `action-tracker` module
    - Provides an `ActionTracker` API that allow coordinating microservices to be made aware when the primary service is
      processing an action and react accordingly e.g. pause operations.
- CLI improvements:
    - New `ActionTrackerOptions` module that can be incorporated into CLI commands that allows microservices to obtain
      and use `ActionTracker` instances as required.
- Kafka Event Source improvements:
    - Fixed a bug where the `KafkaEventSource` could throw an error if trying to commit after being removed from a
      consumer group due to rebalance/timeout. In this scenario a warning is now logged and consumption resumes from
      the most recently committed offset upon the next `poll()` call.
- Build and test improvements:
    - Switched to new Maven Central publishing process
    - Airline upgraded to 3.1.0
    - Apache Commons Lang upgraded to 3.18.0

- Event Source Improvements:
    - **BREAKING** Introduced an `EventHeader` interface which the existing `Header` class implements
        - Various APIs that interact with `Event` have breaking signature changes on some methods to use the
          `EventHeader` interface rather than the `Header` implementation
        - Added new `RawHeader` implementation for event sources that treat header values as byte sequences e.g. Kafka

# 0.28.1

- Kafka Event Source Improvements:
    - `KafkaTestCluster` improves how it creates and deletes topics during tests to ensure that topics are more reliably
      created and deleted as needed
    - `KafkaTestCluster` includes additional informative logging around topic creation and deletion to aid debugging
    - Fix a bug observed when running Surefire with multiple forks where `KafkaTestCluster` logging from different forks

    - `SmartCacheCommandTester.runAsExternalCommand()` now includes the environment variables being set in the logged
      output and fixes an indentation error in the logged command arguments
    - Unnecessary `Thread.sleep()`'s removed from some test classes that should result in some reduction in build times
    - Upgraded Jackson to 2.18.3
    - Upgraded JWT Servlet Auth to 0.17.6
    - Upgraded Logack to 1.5.17
    - Upgraded SLF4J to 2.0.17
    - Upgraded various build and test dependencies to latest available

      integration tests that more directly represent how commands are run in deployments
    - Added default Maven Failsafe Plugin configuration and version control
    - Moved Code Coverage reporting and enforcement to `verify` phase in case any integration tests record additional
      test coverage data

# 0.27.0

- Event Source improvements:
    - `RdfPayload` has new `sizeInBytes()` method that exposes the raw byte sequence size, even if the byte sequence has
      been successfully deserialised and discarded.
- Kafka Event Source improvements:
    - Added new `KafkaReadPolicies.fromExternalOffsets()` static method that allows controlling the Kafka offsets from
      an external `OffsetStore`, rather than Kafka's Consumer Group offset tracking.
    - Added new `resetOffsets()` method to `KafkaEventSource` that allows resetting the offsets to either reprocess
      previous events, or skip over events, as desired.
    - `close()` is more tolerant of errors during closure and ensures that for all managed resources appropriate closure
      actions are taken.
- Projector Driver improvements:
    - `ProjectorDriver` explicitly logs unexpected errors that cause projection to be aborted
    - `ProjectorDriver` now provides additional get methods to allow inspecting some aspects of the driver
- Build and Test Improvements:
    - Further unit and integration test cases added around various `KafkaEventSource` behaviours

# 0.26.2

- Build improvements:
    - Fix some incorrect jaxrs-base-server dependency scope changes that could still cause runtime failures in some
      deployment scenarios
    - Jersey upgraded to 3.1.10
    - OpenTelemetry SDK upgraded 1.46.0

# 0.26.1

- Build improvements:
    - Revert incorrect movement of some jaxrs-base-server dependencies into test scope that was causing runtime failures

# 0.26.0

- Build improvements:
    - Revert upgrade to JAX-RS 4.0 as was causing cryptic build/runtime compatibility issues on some downstream projects
    - New `analyze.failOnWarnings` property can be overridden in modules/projects to skip `dependency:analyze-only` goal
      if the module/project is not yet ready for stricter dependency analysis.

# 0.25.2

- Build improvements
    - Minor dependency cleanup

# 0.25.1

- JAX-RS Base Server improvements:
    - Fixed a bug where `Problem` responses would default to `application/octet-stream` unexpectedly in some cases, it
      should now make best effort to conform to an appropriate `Content-Type` based on clients `Accept` header and any
      content negotation the JAX-RS framework has done prior to the problem being generated as a response.
        - A new `toResponse(HttpHeaders)` overload is added to facilitate this behaviour

# 0.25.0

- Projector improvements:
    - Added new `RejectSink` for explicitly rejecting items that don't match a filter condition.
- Event Source improvements:
    - Added new `EventHeaderSink` for modifying events by adding headers based upon generator functions, including
      built-in support for generating Telicent standard headers.
    - `TelicentHeaders` adds constants for more Telicent standard headers.
    - Adds missing documentation for the existing and new event sinks
- JAX-RS Base Server improvements:
    - Added support for serializing `Problem` response as plain text

# 0.24.2

- Projector improvements:
    - Added new `CleanupSink` to help with scenarios where a projection pipeline may require some `Closeable` resources
      that are not encapsulated in the pipeline itself, e.g. they're only used for initial setup/health probes. This
      new sink allows those to be encapsulated into a pipeline step so that however a pipeline exits it guarantees to
      `close()` those resources.
- Live Reporter improvements:
    - `LiveReporter` now logs a warning if destination sink fails to accept a heartbeat rather than aborting
      unexpectedly.
    - `LiveErrorReporter` now logs a warning if destination sink fails to accept an error report rather than erroring
      unexpectedly.
- Observability improvements:
    - `RuntimeInfo.printRuntimeInfo()` now includes available processors information.
- CLI improvements:
    - `LiveReporterOptions` now offers safer `teardown()` method that handles any unexpected teardown errors such that
      they don't confuse/hide the actual causes of the application termination. Old teardown methods are marked as
      `@Deprecated` with pointers to use the new method.

# 0.24.1

- Kafka Event Source improvements:
    - Improved `KafkaSink` error handling so any Kafka producer errors are reliably surfaced via `SinkException`'s when
      interacting with the sink
- CLI improvements:
    - `AbstractProjectorCommand` more proactively cancels the `ProjectorDriver` on receiving an interrupt, this mainly
      affected scenarios where a command was run in the background for integration tests
- Build improvements:
    - Apache Kafka upgraded to 3.9.0
    - Jackson upgraded to 2.18.1
    - Logback upgraded to 1.5.12
    - OpenTelemetry SDK upgraded to 1.44.1
    - Various build and test plugins upgraded to latest available

# 0.24.0

- Kafka Event Source improvements:
    - `KafkaTestCluster` abstract class now has a `getClientProperties()` method to supply a default set of additional
      client properties needed to connect to the Kafka cluster type being tested. This simplifies writing unit and
      integration tests against secure clusters in particular
- CLI improvements:
    - Fix several cases where extra Kafka configuration is not passed into ancillary components - Live Reporter and DLQs
    - `debug` CLI commands modified to work with secured Kafka configuration
- Build improvements:
    - Apache Jena upgraded to 5.2.0
    - Jersey upgraded to 3.1.9

# 0.23.1

- Build improvements:
    - Addressing Trivy OOM errors in pipeline

# 0.23.0

- Kafka Event Source improvements:
    - **BREAKING:** `KafkaTestCluster` is now an abstract class, use `BasicKafkaTestCluster` for the default
      implementation of the interface
    - New `MutualTlsKafkaTestCluster` can be used to create a single node mTLS Authenticated Kafka Cluster provided
      that suitable Key and Trust Stores are generated
    - New `certs-helper` artifact provides helper scripts to enable generating these in other modules and test
      environments
- CLI improvements:
    - Added new `--kafka-login-type` option to select between different SASL mechanisms
    - Added new `--kafka-property` option to supply custom Kafka configuration properties directly at command line
    - Added new `--kafka-properties` option to supply Kafka properties file where more complex configuration is
      necessary, or users don't want to expose sensitive values in the CLI arguments
- Build improvements:
    - Excluded `protobuf-java` from transitive dependencies due to CVE-2024-7254 and adding explicit dependency on
      4.28.2
    - Removed `apache-jena-libs` from dependency management in favour of explicit dependencies on specific Jena
      libraries we use
    - JWT Servlet Auth upgraded to 0.17.0
    - Logback upgraded to 1.5.8
    - OpenTelemetry SDK upgraded to 1.42.1
    - RDF ABAC upgraded to 0.71.8
    - Various build and test dependencies upgraded to latest available

# 0.22.0

- JAX-RS Base Server improvements:
    - `ServerBuilder` now defaults to listening on `0.0.0.0`, i.e. all interfaces, rather than `localhost` which reduces
      inadvertent configuration errors where the server only listens on `localhost` and isn't accessible in some
      deployment scenarios e.g. running in a container.
    - `ServerBuilder` adds new `allInterfaces()` method to make it explicit that you want to listen on all interfaces
      when building your server.
    - New `RandomPortProvider` in `tests` module to make it easier to manage generating a sequence of psuedo-random port
      numbers to avoid port collisions between tests.
    - `AbstractHealthResource` now caches the computed `HealthStatus` for 30 seconds to remove the ability for a
      malicious user to DoS attack a server (and its underlying services where those are probed as part of computing the
      health status) via its `/healthz` endpoint.
    - **BREAKING:** `AbstractApplication` **MUST** now override a new `getHealthResourceClass()` method to supply either
      a resource class derived from `AbstractHealthResource` or `null` if it does not want to provide a `/healthz`
      endpoint. This change is designed to ensure that all application developers at least consider whether a health
      resource is needed and to ensure they receive the DoS attack mitigation also included in this release.
- Build improvements:
    - Removed unnecessary `logback.xml` from some library modules as these could conflict with application provided
      logging configurations
    - Removed Jetty dependency since only a tiny piece of utility code was being used and was replaced by usage of
      Apache Commons Lang

# 0.21.1

- CLI improvements:
    - `HealthProbeServer` now runs on a background daemon thread with a more minimal thread pool footprint to improve
      health probe responsiveness and reduce resource consumption
    - `HealthProbeServer` now listens on `0.0.0.0` so is more reliably usable in containerised environments
- General improvements:
    - Several background threads that may be run by various APIs now explicitly set the thread name where possible to
      make it easier to debug applications using these features.

# 0.21.0

- CLI improvements:
    - New `cli-probe-server` module provides an embeddable `HealthProbeServer` that allows adding a minimalist HTTP
      server into CLI apps to provide suitable endpoints for Liveness and Readiness checks.
    - New `HealthProbeServerOptions` class in `cli-core` for adding this capability into your commands
    - **BREAKING** `AbstractProjectorCommand` now automatically includes `HealthProbeServerOptions` and sets up the
      server, derived classes need to implement a new `Supplier<HealthStatus> getHealthProbeSupplier()` method to supply
      a function that computes their applications readiness status.

      Telemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/).

# 0.12.2

- Add dead letter queue message header, `TelicentHeaders.DEAD_LETTER_REASON`

# 0.12.1

- JAX-RS Base Server improvements:
    - Fix a bug where `ServerBuilder.contextPath()` could not be called with a plain `/` as the context path even though
      that is the default value indicating the root context.
    - Added a new `ServerBuilder.rootContextPath()` method to explicitly configure `/` as the desired context path.
- Build Improvements:
    - When `-DskipTests` is used on a build code coverage enforcement is now also skipped

# 0.12.0

- General Improvements:
    - Builder APIs that provide base classes now use self-referential type parameters to make their APIs more fluent and
      remove compiler constraints on calling the derived and base methods in any particular order.

      to be defined using lambdas.
    - Various dependencies upgraded to latest versions as appropriate.
- Event Source Improvements:
    - New `consumerConfig()` and `producerConfig()` methods on relevant builders to allow injecting arbitrary Kafka
      configuration properties.
    - New `plainLogin()` methods on relevant builders to allow providing credentials for Kafka clusters that enable
      authentication via Plaintext SASL.
    - New `SecureKafkaTestCluster` test harness for writing unit and integration tests against Kafka with Plaintext SASL
      login enabled.
    - `KafkaEvent` now exposes a `getConsumerRecord()` which provides access to the underlying Kafka `ConsumerRecord`
      instance where necessary.
- CLI Improvements:
    - `SmartCacheCommand` now provides `--verbose`, `--trace` and `--quiet` options that can reconfigure the root
      logging level at runtime. These are automatically provided to and honoured by any command that uses the
      `SmartCacheCommand` API to run itself. Since only the root logger level is changed any application logging
      configuration that explicitly sets the level for another logger remains honoured.
    - `SmartCacheCommand` processing will now dump runtime environment information (Memory, Java Version and OS) during
      command startup unless disabled via new `--no-runtime-info` option.
    - Added `--kafka-username` and `--kafka-password` options for supplying Kafka credentials for use with Plaintext
      SASL authentication.
    - **BREAKING** Deprecated `Defaults` class in favour of new `Configurator` API
- JAX-RS Base Server improvements:
    - Added `Accept`, `Content-Disposition` and `Content-Type` into `Access-Control-Allowed-Headers` response to CORS
      requests. While `Accept` and `Content-Type` were implicitly permitted due to the CORS safe-list not all values for
      those headers were permitted which prevented some APIs being called from a browser.
    - **BREAKING** Deprecated `CorsResponseFilter` in favour of `CrossOriginFilter` (from Jetty)
    - Added new `CorsConfigurationBuilder` for configuring CORS as desired.  `ServerBuilder` gains new `withCors()` and
      `withoutCors()` methods for passing in/manipulating this configuration as needed.
    - Default automatic server initialisation now includes printing runtime environment information (Memory, Java
      Version and OS).
- Debugging Improvements:
    - Packaged the `debug` CLI into a Docker image and provides some wrapper scripts for invoking common debug
      functionality needed by developers.
- New `configurator` module
    - Provides a minimalist lightweight abstraction for obtaining configuration values
    - Makes it much easier for developers to write unit and integration tests that require specific configurations

# 0.11.2

  via multiple independent Maven SureFire/FailSafe invocations have all their coverage collected and reported

# 0.11.1

- Event Source improvements:
    - `KafkaEventSource`:
        - Now handles a background thread calling `processed()` correctly by delaying offset commits until the thread
          that owns the underlying `KafkaConsumer` next accesses it.
        - Logging has been toned down to be less noisy at default log level (`INFO`) and some warnings are now issued
          less frequently
        - Topic existence checking used to avoid flooding the logs with Unknown Topic or Partition errors
        - Blocking `poll()` calls should be promptly interrupted when an application is shutting down
- Projector Driver changes:
    - **BREAKING**: Removed `pollWarnThreshold()` and associated logging from `ProjectorDriver` and its builder since
      this logging has proved to be unnecessary noise.
    - Toned down various aspects of the logging and made some statements be issued less frequently
- CLI Improvements:
    - If a projector command dies with an unexpected `Throwable` we now print the stack trace to standard error

# 0.11.0

- New `live-reporter` module
    - Provides a `LiveReporter` for reporting application status heartbeats for use by our Telicent Live monitoring
      application.
    - Provides a `LiveErrorReporter` for reporting application errors for use by our Telicent Live monitoring
      application.
- Event Source changes:
    - **BREAKING**: `event-source-file` module has refactored the internal implementation of `YamlEventSource` to reuse
      the Kafka serializers and deserializers to remove special case code. This involved some breaking changes to the
      internal APIs and implementations that are reflected elsewhere in these libraries.
        - Added a new `SingleFileEventSource` for special case of just ingesting a single file
        - Added a new `RdfFileEventSource` for ingesting plain RDF files (only `Content-Type` header derived from file
          format and no key support)
        - Added new `FileEventFormatProvider` interface driven by JVM `ServiceLoader` with `FileEventFormats` registry
- Projector Driver changes:
    - **BREAKING**: `ProjectorDriver` no longer has a public constructor and must now be built using a Builder pattern
      via `ProjectorDriver.create()`
    - **BREAKING**: Moved all driver related classes into `driver` package to avoid split package between this module
      and `projectors-core`
- CLI improvements:
    - Added new `--live-reporter`/`--no-live-reporter` option to relevant commands for enabling/disabling the new Live
      Reporter feature.
    - Added `--live-reporter-topic` and `--live-reporter-interval` options for configuring the Kafka topic to which
      status heartbeats are sent and how frequently they are sent.
    - Added `--live-bootstrap-servers` option for configuring the Kafka bootstrap topic for commands that wouldn't
      normally involve a Kafka connection.
    - Improved the restrictions related to configuring the event source, this should make it easier to use file event
      sources for testing when desired.
    - Added new `--source-file` option for providing a single file as an event source
    - Improved `--source-format` and `--capture-format` options to more actively reflect supported event file formats
- Base Server improvements:
    - Added new `RequestIdFilter` to the base application specification. This adds a `Request-ID` header to all HTTP
      requests and places it into the Logging `MDC` so logging configuration can include it in their patterns.
    - `CorsResponseFilter` now permits additional headers in pre-flight requests and responses.
    - When running in blocking mode on a background thread ensures that the server is stopped when that background
      thread is cancelled/interrupted
- **BREAKING**: `entity-collector` and `ies-configuration` modules removed:
    - These module have been migrated into the Smart Cache Search repository
- Dependencies
    - Various dependencies upgraded to latest minor/patch versions as appropriate
