/**
 * Represents an RDF Payload, this may either be a purely additive {@link DatasetGraph} or a mutative {@link RDFPatch}
 * containing an ordered sequence of additions and deletions.
 * <p>
 * As of {@code 0.14.0} payloads are lazily deserialised, meaning that they hold the raw RDF value, and only deserialize
 * it when a consumer actually accesses it for the first time via the {@link #getDataset()} or {@link #getPatch()}
 * methods.  This avoids malformed RDF, or RDF events with incorrect {@code Content-Type} headers, causing head of line
 * blocking because it allows for the event to always be read from Kafka.  Consumers need to take note of the new
 * {@link RdfPayloadException} that may be thrown by these methods when they attempt to deserialise an invalid RDF event
 * and handle these appropriately.
