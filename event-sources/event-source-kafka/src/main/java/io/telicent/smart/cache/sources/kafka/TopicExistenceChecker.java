/**
 * A helper utility that abstracts the checking of topic existence (and caching the results of those checks).  The
 * existence checks run on background threads using an {@link AdminClient}.  Once a topic is determined to exist then
 * that result is cached for the lifetime of this instance. This allows the instance to quickly answer whether any of
 * its configured topics exist, while also continuing to check and see if those known to be non-existent are created
 * later.
 * <p>
 * Primarily this is used inside {@link KafkaEventSource} as a sanity check to avoid unnecessarily polling the broker if
 * none of the topics exist.  This is done because when no topics exist Kafka's logging is very noisy and can
 * effectively flood the logs making seeing anything useful in them difficult.
